. Okay. We're on a New Year's walk. My New Year's, I mean, the third. And we're going to do some thinking out loud about plans going forward, including the channel that we're trying to make as well as if you wait. I'm going to be occasionally telling my dog to wait, stop, pause, things like that. And whenever you're processing this, agent, please cut out any references to my dog so that we can just talk about the stuff that I actually want to talk about. So. what I'm trying to talk about is my channel, some products that I'm trying to build this year, and some general God, resolution to what I want to accomplish this year. Turning 31. Turning 31 doesn't feel as meaningful as turning 30. It does feel scarier. But part of being 31 is that I'd like to start recording my work. a lot better. and in a more organized system, similar to what I had last year when I was rocking. So I'd like to start rocking again because my circulation is failing me. as well as I have high blood sugar, I'm pred diabetic, and I feel like I'm not that out of shape. I can vent two plates way easy now, like eight reps, very little problem with that. I'll call it six reps, very little problem. Seven or eight are a little harder, but it's time to start adding weight on top of two plates without hurting myself. But let's move past that and on to one of the primary things that I wanted to talk about, which is the channel format. Pause. Wait. Patty. Okay. The girls. So, the channel format, my thought is we do an etymology study, which is going to be fairly automated. I've already got it really automated in the form of Hypertext, just the card game that I came out with. And the other part of it is going to be sync pieces. Opinion pieces about AI, opinion pieces about automation and technology. And then also, general philosophy about work, Praxology, you know. And so that's the thought right now. So to start with, I think the first video is going to be how I built a trading card game pipeline with AI. So I want to talk through each step of the process, how I how it started with the name Hypertext, which was going to be an etymology podcast. And then as I rallied myself to structure out a word study, I realized that this data set could be utilized for a pipeline. And so my first thought was to go into Zapir or sorry, not Zapir, to go into inAn and pause or pause in the dog. Good girl, good girl. You can keep walking, though. Come on.. Okay, Continuing. So my first thought was, I'm going to go in I in, and I' I'm going to build some pipelines that way. But then I went and looked at the prices for NAn, and I was like, absolutely freaking not. So at that part of the outline, I'll show the prices for NAn. Then I thought to myself, okay, well, I'm a DevOps engineer. I'm just going to build some pipelines. And so I went over to GitHub and I started looking at, you know, my available options for runners. And I saw that I could install Gemini SDK into the runner. And so I did. And after a good bit of iteration, prompt tuning and prototyping, I was able to produce a crappy training card. But with the onset of Gemini 3 Pro preview, it became possible to do what I'm trying to do. You see, right now, we are at a turning point in AI because AI has solved text generation. Google has solved text generation on the images. This is massive. And I don't see a lot of people talking about how massive it is, but it is massiveive. Because now, not only can you generate trading cards, you could generate things like network diagrams. You can generate things like, let's find a few other examples here, and I'm open to some suggestion at some metaarrative. But I decided, I am this holiday break. I am going to create a determinist AI system that generates a stylistic format of trading cards and outputs of trading card every day. Then I will compile this trading card and attempt to publish it. So really, after the first, you know, small prototype win, I was like, okay, what I actually need to do first is develop a rule set for this game. And so I came up with a rule set for hypertext. And then me and my dad went back and forth about how terrible an aim hypertext is, but I decided to stick with it because you got to stick to your convictions. So, Hypertext Towerfall began. I created a card back, and I created a rule system for Hypertext Towerfall, spaced around a game that I played in my childhood called Shanghai, and I decided to make a roguelike Shanghai deck building experience. Once again, this was a 10-day personal hackathon type thing. So I'm just going to, I decided to just keep rolling with the intuitions and release my inhibitions fill theorraine on my skin. Anyways. I I proceeded to re-architect the format of the card, and then, once I had a good understanding of what I wanted the card to look like, and what I wanted the abilityilities to do, and be able to do, I fed the rules into my dynamic prompting system so that what was output in the planning phase was a recipe for a card that could play in the games. And so I ended up with cards like this, and I'll show two of those cards. Now begins the part that is very difficult, and that is programmatically utilizing style references in Gemini. I started out with just a set of decent cards and a bass template, and then referenced that bass template as the most weighted version. And then I generated some cards out of that. What, I ended up for cards like this. And I'll show the demo cards that I came up with. That's when I thought to myself, okay, this can work, though I'm getting a lot of inconsistencies. However, I'll worry about the inconsistencies later and what I'm going to do right now. is I'm going to playtest this thing. And so what I did was I built a pipeline or outputting the cards into an Office max compatible format of a print sheet. And this is the print sheet that it ends up with and I'll show the PDF of the print sheet. Then I actually asked to skip a step. So Agent, please recognize that we need to insert a section before we talk about the print sheet. I realized that I need a way to revise these cards. So if they come out with either an ability that isn't flavorful or minor missteps on the formatting, I can regenerate them and then it'll come out correctly. So what I did was I built a pipeline. And I think I built a pipeline is going to have to be a little, you know, repeated term. But I built a pipeline to where every card is generated with a template called revised.text. Then, whenever I edit revised.text and I push it into the same branch, it kicks off a pipeline that revises the card through a series of programmatic props, and on the other side of it, I get a card with that revision. And I can show that in the form of a full request. I also made it to where the cards are published. The rendered cards are published as comments on the PR. So I have a quick entry into where it looks like. Then what I did was I created a Then I thought to myself, okay, what do I want? You know, publishing the cards to a ER is good, but I want a quick reference to be able to see what's going on with the card or with the the series of cards at a glance. And so I thought to myself, I could create a webpage that hosts all of the cards similar to other trading card game websites. And let's you filter, not a type, the rarity, et cet, etc, as well as a place to host the rules. And so I built a pipeline for publishing GitHub pages whenever I commit to mains. So now we're at what is that? Count three of pipelines. Then I decided, you know what? I don't want to just run the daily whenever I want to test this thing. I want to be able to create demo cards. Oh, I created a pipeline for creating demo cards. Some background to me. My favorite games in the world, actually, my favorite game in the world, is a game called Satisfactory. And I can show some videos of satisfactory, where it's a gamified automation. But. I'm not somebody who will then go and create No Tre Dame inside or satisfactory. I normally get inspiration from it, and then I start building codes. because for me, code is the best game, especially in the age of AI. And my process these days is I am a thorough, thorough thorough vibe coder. I wish that I wasn't. And I've taken CS50. I've coded in C to do all the cool stuff that you do there. Built plenty of web apps, some test prototype apps. But I wouldn't call myself a web developer. I wouldn't call myself a software developer. I would 100% call myself a dev ops engineer. So I I am actually a senior DevOps engineer. And what I do in my spare time is I build automations for funds and I study automation theory. And I try and find the best ways to automate my hobbies. And so I have a few things that automate my hobbies, such as I have a CLI that lets you cast spells called Magi CLI. And whenever I publish Domain, the air kicks it off to PI. And whenever I create a new spell and I publish it to the spells repository, it publishes that to the Magi website. And I'm always just trying to build something fun that also grows my skill. And so this was another example of that. Normally, at this stage, I would have already moved from Python to go, but I decided that go might be a little extra for this one. when it's all running out of a pyeline anyway. I stuck with python. But I have a few other really cool experiments in Go that I'll talk about later for. For now, I just want to explain how I got to a pipeline that utilizes Gen AI to generate a deterministic state standardized trading fr game, because I believe that this recipe is useful in other capacities, especially for those other people who are trying to iterate on prototypes. So, I started there, I got to the point where I could output a print sheet, and I also got to the point where I could output to a format that the Game crafter would accept and the form of 25 card batches. All right, Via, hi, heel, wait. Via. Hi. Morning. Yeah, her too. She's good, but always has some speaker mind. You too. Go. Thea, this way. Okay, we're unpaused back to the game. So I decided to print it out at Office Max on card stock in this format. And I spent two hours cutting out the game. Probably should have got some V-roll I was cutting. That would have been hard. Sometime over this next year, I'm going to get AR glasses. And those are useful for other things, like giving speeches and presentations. but also for just recording hands free. But anyways, I printed out the game at Office Max. I cut it up in a 60 card batch. I attempted 90 cards, but 30 of the cards came out in a bad format. 60 of the cards were playable. All the lots are semi-playable. Talk about lots later. Honestly, if you guys are interested in the rules of the game, I can make another video about that. But I figure those people who are just trying to iterate fast will be more interested in the method I got to for generating the cards. So, Nixie cards came out good. It's a low win rate, right? What is that? Saturday? 75% of cards? You not correct? So I decided to just keep that rate, cut them out, and me and my wife shuffled up, played the first game game. I did a lot. However, ended up with a bunch of rules changes, such as instead of just drawing one card or playing it, you can either play it or draw two cards, things like that. L values changed. And here's the cool part about AI during the play testing process. Because I built this game. as code, a board game as code, I was able to keep COD code running during the playtest phase, and anytime we came up with a rule that made sense or a change that made sense, I just told Claude Code to go and integrate that into the rules. And because it integrated into the rules in the rules.MD, that's what was published to the website and that website then became the standard. And not only the website, but the programmatic prompt, which utilized the rules for the recipe building for the cards,, also changed. And so cards became more consistent to the rules, and they altogether more playable game. So.. proceeding from there, I went and playtested with a couple other friends, came up with some good rules changes. And honestly, the four-play playtest didn't change much. The game was playing pretty well. And so I stuck with that. Then the real challenge began. Style referencing. So Google Gemini over the past year has been the frontrunner of Image Generation. And they have also, in the past month, in the past few months, solved text generation and consistent graphics generation. So how they did this was through style references. This is where I'll go into what it means to pass in a style reference. And I'll also just kind of hand wave to. There's a lot of people who have covered style generation or style referencing for Sprite generation, but this method of style referencing was not possible until Google solved text generation. And when I say solved, I mean, like, they have 85% solved and that I get the correct response 85 to 90% of the time. There's still the 10% that requires human in the loop. And I'll make a future video about the current state of agent in the loop and human in the loop with AI systems, oil the cool machines, things like that. But right now, I'm just trying to kick the channel off. So here we go. I realized that I would not have the consistency that I needed unless I had a textual representation, or sorry, unless I had a style representation of each combination of card. That is a verb, now a noun, an adjective, a title, and a name, alongside the rarity for each one of these. And one of the things that came out of the playtest with the multiple players was they wanted a formatting change that made it easier to identify the rarity in the type of the card at a glance. This is a due to Shanghai's by rule.s. in hypertext, you can redeem from SHEL in the same way you can buy from Discard in Shanghai. But this requires you to be able to see what you need at a glands and know what you need and be able to call it before the players can. So I had to introduce some new graphical elements and those graphical elements are made it much more difficult to represent in batch. So I had to come up with a method, COA. I had to come up with a method to represent the style I was going for at generation. Morning. And in order to do so, I had to come up with templates for each type of card and each rarity of card. I then had to generate example cards that were properly formatted for each rarity in type in all combinations. And then I passed in those cards in this weighted reference labeled at each rarity and type and template versus examples. And so that took an entire day of curating because the hardest part about this method is getting your templates and getting your examples. Once you have your templates, and once you have your examples, it just becomes tunicing. And the tuning isn't that hard. But in order to get to the marble block, you have to go mining. And so I have to a full day of staring at my examples, forwarding my allowance a hundred bucks. I ended up with a pretty good system. And that pretty good system worked. This is what I now end up with. And I'll show examples of good cards. So let's wrap all that back up. This is what my current DICD project, Get Ops based Gen AI Hard Factory looks like. Now, I would love now something in me tells me that I should open source this. You know, I'm open source it for three benefits. One of them. If I throw it out into the world, people will improve it. But it also risks people just taking it and using it for their benefits. Without crediting me. And this is capitalism, folks. You know, I want to benefit you guys with some learned experience. But I also got to feed my family. So what I've done is I have packaged up the code into a purchasable template that I'm calling a trading card factory. or I might call it something else. Probably a little more thematic. Let me thank you. Names are important to me. I feel like they add a lot to a product. So I would call this....er. something like that. I might fix that in post. But it's a factory for producing trading cards based on templates, per type, per rarity. and you can take it and do whatever you want from there. But for me, this is what works. So I'm all about copying homework. I didn't actually copy anybody else's homework for this. I started from scratch. And I respect people who want to start from scratch. But if you don't want to start from scratch, you can, there was a lot of work that went into this. A lot of time that I could have spent with my family over the holidays, but instead, I packaged it up. But instead, I focused on building a card game. Now That's not to say. I didn't spend a lot of time with my family over the holidays. It was a great holiday break. But I'm going back to work. And so I want to make sure that I have protected. And so I'm put on all rights reserve license on the repo. If you end up using it, please credit me. This is a powerful software that can generate at scale card games. So. Agent note, meta note. Help me refine this section. to where I can protect my stuff. I'm still benefiting people. I'm still peeking people's interest, but I'm not giving away the secret sauce because secret sauce is important to me. Okay, so, this will be where I go over the function of the the factory and what it ended up with. Okay, I think that about covers the video. I think there's going to be a lot more iteration. But I think it gives you what you need. to help me work with it. Next. Next, we talk about.. Plants for the Year. Plants for the Channel. And this can be in the video. This is primarily out of the video. I'm just thinking through. where I need to be going with the video. Oh. Let's think. So next thought is about long porn videos, short porn videos, medium form videos. I need to have a structure for generating long form videos, which are probably 30 minute scripts, high production quality, you know, good output, good structure. I think these will be the video pairs, see my articles. And then medium form videos will actually be my articles Whoa hyper focused into specific topics from those videos, and we'll set up a workflow for chunking my art.ia, Thea, Thea! Chunking my articles into multiple videos. This will be useful a number of things. But mainly, it will be good for content planning. Because if we can break out an article into three focused 15 minute videos, that's enough for people to latch on, you know, and put it in the background what they're doing doing something. But I'm also going to need to have 30 to 45 minute formats, because that's the expected video essay format. And I need to come up with a good man method of video formatting. One of the projects that I want to work on as part of this is an OBS-based python-based motion capture graphic slinging method. I'm calling it spell sling. I have it working for throwing orbs around, but I need to get it working for throwing graphics around that are acued, and I can stage those graphics on different key captures and those key captures determine what I'm about to throw. And pressing one locks it and then pressing it again, turns it off, and I'll have a key on another screen that shows, or that indicates what buttons are attached to what. But the actual display will only show the graphics that I'm throwing. Okay. I think that's enough of a digestion for now. I might start another video on this walk for another journal on this walk, but I think this one is ready to throw in an agent to digest. Cool. Sign off.
